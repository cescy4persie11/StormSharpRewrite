# StormSharp

**05/10/2016**
- Fixed situations where Orbwalk sometimes does not attack after spells
- Now ChaseZip will zip to Mouse Position
- ChaseZip will have a special target lock, which constantly shows on the right side, you can attack ground or attack enemy to unlock/relock the target, which is re-selected as the closest to Mouse.
- ChaseZip is best used by: with the right target locked(right click target or Attack around the target), Hold or Press hotkey with your mouse being at the desired position. 
 - Moving or Casting spells will not unlock the target
 - there is no attack clicks needed if you don't want to change target.
 - You may try a few times before getting used to it.
 - I made this change based on the games I have played and seems orbwalk is not always optimal as positioning is so important.
